# Web Application Architectures WorkShop 3 : HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS

## WS 3.1 Simple HTML / CSS : BLOCK vs INLINE, ELEMENTS POSITIONING , FONTS

### The Box Model, BLOCK Elements, INLINE Elements :

The first thing to learn to code nice Web apps, is how to position elements on the screen, and how content is positionned inside elements.

**Must read:**  https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/ in case you did not.  
**Must read:**  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp
**Must read:**  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements

you must understand difference between BLOCK and INLINE Html elements 
PLEASE Remember : 

BLOCK elements `<P>,<H1>,<OL>,<TABLE><DIV>`... :
- takes full width of the page (flows top to bottom)
- Have Height and Width, that can be modified
- Can have block or inline elements as children

INLINE elements `<A>,<EM>,<BR>,<SPAN>`... :
- Take as much width as needed by their content (flows left to right, like text in a book)  
- Cannot have height and width. If you try to set it it will be ignored.  
- Cannot have a block element child. if you put a block element inside an inline element, browser will treat them as if they where outside.  
- Cannot be positioned

INLINE-Block elements `<IMG>` :
- inline content with height and width `<IMG>`

You can change the behaviour of elements using the display: CSS property  

don't put BLOCK elements inside INLINE elements !  
dont' try to apply block properties to inline elements !

### Fonts :

you must understand how fonts are displayed in a browser. Sometimes, a font you choosed will not be available on a visitor's computer. His browser will then have to pick another font. Visually speaking, the results could break all your design work !

### Exercise :

- one that will Uppercase all the buttons text
- one that will Lowercase all the buttons text
- one that will write a huge HELLO WORLD! in the center of the page.
